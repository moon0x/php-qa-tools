## Usage

This is a simple metapackage which can be used in two different ways; globally installed or on a per project basis.

Both methods have their strengths (+) and weaknesses (-).

**Global installation**:

- \+ All tools are present anywhere on your system
- \+ Can be used on any codebase, even the ones that don't use Composer.
- \- You'll have to update manually, since it's not a project, versioning is not managed.

**Per project installation**:

- \+ Versioning (update/installation) is provided in the project
- \- Tools not available system wide. You'll need to run them from a specific path.

These methods are not mutual exclusive. You can have your global installed version, which can be used anywhere, but
still use the one provided in a project.

## Installation

### Global installation

The following script will install a system wide Composer for you, including the QA tools.

```bash
bash <(curl -S https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dealerdirect/php-qa-tools/master/bin/install.sh)
```

That's it. This can be put in any instructions, such as a README or someone's blog, since the logic is in the shell
script. Provided you download the script using https, the file has standard levels of authentication and encryption
protecting it from manipulation. We also sign the install with a GPG key, this way you can check if the downloaded
releases signature matches the public key of Dealerdirect.

```bash
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys C4133165DF5EB4BAEABDADCACF1E7823C5339B59
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dealerdirect/php-qa-tools/master/bin/install.sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dealerdirect/php-qa-tools/master/bin/install.sh.sig
gpg --verify install.sh.sig
bash install.sh
```

This is obviously a shell script, if you're really concerned about the argument that it may contain nefarious
activities within, you can easily review it before you run it.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dealerdirect/php-qa-tools/master/bin/install.sh
less install.sh
bash instal.sh
```

If you already have a global Composer setup, you could include the tools manually, without the need for running
the shell script above.

```bash
composer global require "dealerdirect/qa-tools:*"
```

#### Per project installation

The other option is to install this on a per project basis.

Using Composer (preferred method):

```bash
composer require --dev "dealerdirect/qa-tools"
```

Or modify your `composer.json` to include `dealerdirect/qa-tools` in the `require-dev` sections:

```json
{
  "name": "acme/my-project",
  "require": {
    "…": "*"
  },
  "require-dev": {
    "dealerdirect/qa-tools": "*"
  }
}
```
